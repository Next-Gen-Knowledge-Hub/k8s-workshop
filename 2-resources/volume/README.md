# üóÑÔ∏è Volumes: Attaching Disk Storage to Containers

In the previous chapters, we explored core Kubernetes resources like **Pods**, **ReplicaSets**, **DaemonSets**, **Jobs**, and **Services**. In this section, we dive **back inside the pod** to see how containers can interact with **external disk storage** or **share storage among themselves** using **Volumes**.

---

## 1 - Introducing Volumes

Volumes in Kubernetes allow containers in a pod to **read and write data** to shared or persistent storage. Unlike standalone Kubernetes objects like Pods or Services, volumes are always defined **within a Pod's specification**‚Äîthey **cannot exist independently**.

---

## 1.1 - Volumes Explained with an Example

A common use case involves **multiple containers sharing data**:

> Imagine a web server container that writes logs to `/var/log`, and a sidecar container that reads and processes those logs‚Äîlike a log collector or cleaner.

This scenario requires **shared storage**, and Kubernetes volumes make it possible.

---

## 1.2 - Available Volume Types

Kubernetes supports a wide array of volume types, suitable for both **ephemeral** and **persistent** storage needs.

| Volume Type             | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| `emptyDir`              | Temporary storage, created when a pod starts. Deleted when the pod is removed. |
| `hostPath`              | Mounts a host node directory into the pod. Useful for debugging and node-specific configs. |
| `persistentVolumeClaim` | Connects to a PersistentVolume, often used with dynamic storage provisioning. |
| `configMap`             | Mounts config data as files or environment variables. |
| `secret`                | Used to securely inject passwords, tokens, or keys. |
| `projected`             | Combines multiple sources like `configMap` and `secret` into one volume. |
| `downwardAPI`           | Exposes pod metadata (e.g., labels, annotations) to the container. |
| `nfs`, `cephFS`, `glusterfs` | Distributed network file systems; require external setup. |
| `gcePersistentDisk`, `awsElasticBlockStore`, `azureDisk`, `azureFile` | Cloud provider-specific persistent storage. |
| `local`                 | Mounts a local disk; not suitable for multi-node portability. |
| `csi`                   | Supports pluggable third-party storage drivers via the **Container Storage Interface**. |
| `flexVolume`            | Deprecated in favor of CSI, but still in use for some vendor plugins. |
| `iscsi`, `cinder`, `vsphereVolume`, `storageOS` | Enterprise and cloud-specific storage integrations. |

> üîç For most learning and development environments, `emptyDir` and `hostPath` are easiest to start with.

## 2 - Using Volumes to Share Data Between Containers

While volumes are useful for a **single container**, they really shine when **multiple containers in a pod** need to **share state** or **communicate via files**.

---

### 2.1 - Using an `emptyDir` Volume

`emptyDir` is a **temporary volume** created when a pod is assigned to a node. It‚Äôs:

- **Empty initially**
- **Deleted** when the pod terminates
- **Shared** between all containers in the pod

#### Example: Web Server & Log Collector

Let‚Äôs walk through an example where a web server writes logs to a shared volume, and a sidecar container collects them.

```sh
# Create the deployment with two containers and an emptyDir volume
kubectl create -f sample/k8s_deployment.yaml

# Expose the deployment as a service
kubectl create -f sample/k8s_service.yaml
```

#### Verify Pod and Service

```sh
kubectl get pods
```

Output:
```
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
log-mount-deployment-7c464cbc94-62djq   2/2     Running   0          3m29s
```

```sh
kubectl get services
```

Output:
```
NAME                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
log-mount-service   NodePort    10.98.14.198   <none>        8888:32407/TCP   5s
```

```sh
minikube service list
```

Output:
```
| default     | log-mount-service | 8888 | http://192.168.49.2:32407 |
```

#### Test the Application

```sh
curl http://192.168.49.2:32407/
```

This sends a request to the web server which writes to the shared volume.

#### View Logs of Both Containers

```sh
# Server container
kubectl logs pods/log-mount-deployment-7c464cbc94-62djq

# Collector container
kubectl logs pods/log-mount-deployment-7c464cbc94-62djq log-mount-collector
```

Example Output from Collector:
```
2024/12/14 07:44:23 INFO log file path=/tmp/
2024/12/14 07:46:05 INFO file modified path=/tmp/server.txt op=WRITE
```

# üíæ Using Persistent Storage in Kubernetes

There are situations where an application **must retain data** even after the pod it‚Äôs running in is terminated or rescheduled. For such cases, simple volumes like `emptyDir` or `hostPath` won‚Äôt work because their lifecycle is tied to the pod or the node. Instead, we need **persistent storage** that can outlive pods and be **accessible across different nodes** in the cluster.

---

## 3 - Using Persistent Storage

When a pod requires data **persistence across restarts or rescheduling**, it must rely on **network-attached storage (NAS)** or **cluster-managed storage systems** that are independent of pod or node lifecycle.

A common use case is deploying a database like **MongoDB** with data persistence.

```bash
# Create a PersistentVolume, PersistentVolumeClaim, and MongoDB deployment
kubectl create -f k8s_persitstant_volume.yaml
```

> üí° This configuration uses a **Persistent Volume (PV)** backed by local disk or external storage to ensure that MongoDB‚Äôs data is retained across pod restarts.

---

## 4 - Decoupling Pods from the Underlying Storage Technology

Early approaches to storage in Kubernetes required **developers to understand** the cluster's underlying storage infrastructure. This tightly coupled applications to specific technologies and limited flexibility.

### üß± The Problem
Imagine needing to update from NFS to CSI-based cloud storage‚Äîyou‚Äôd have to modify every pod definition that used it. That's not scalable.

---

## 4.1 - PersistentVolumes (PV) & PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC)

To solve this, Kubernetes introduces **two abstractions**:

| Resource              | Purpose |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **PersistentVolume (PV)** | Represents a piece of storage provisioned by an administrator. Think of it as the "supply" side of storage. |
| **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)** | A user's request for storage. Defines how much space and which access modes are required. It's the "demand" side. |

```bash
# Apply a manifest that includes both PV and PVC resources
kubectl create -f k8s_persitstant_volume.yaml

# View the available persistent volumes
kubectl get persistentvolume

# View the claims made by the user/application
kubectl get persistentvolumeclaims
```

### üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Cluster Admin** creates one or more PersistentVolumes (PV):
    - Specifies size, access modes, and backend storage type (e.g., NFS, local, cloud disk).
2. **Developer/User** creates a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC):
    - Requests a specific amount of storage and access mode (e.g., `ReadWriteOnce`).
3. **Kubernetes Controller** matches a PVC to an appropriate PV and **binds them**.
4. The pod can then **mount the PVC** as a volume.

> üéØ **Goal:** Developers don‚Äôt have to worry about storage provisioning‚Äîthey simply ask for it, and Kubernetes handles the rest.

---

## üìå Summary

- For persistent storage, use **PersistentVolumes (PV)** and **PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC)**.
- These abstractions **decouple storage configuration from pod definitions**, making applications portable and reusable.
- Storage can be **manually provisioned** by admins or **dynamically provisioned** using StorageClasses.
- Once a claim is bound, the pod can safely write and read data from the mounted volume‚Äîeven across node failures or restarts.
- Kubernetes **Volumes** allow **data sharing** between containers or **persistent storage** across pod restarts.
- The simplest volume type, **`emptyDir`**, is great for intra-pod communication.
- Many **advanced volume types** (like `PVC`, `CSI`, or cloud-specific options) enable long-term, scalable storage.
- Sidecar containers are a common pattern for volume-based log collection, backup, or data processing.

---

## ‚úÖ Bonus Tips

- Use **`volumeMounts`** to define mount paths for each container.
- Always clean up test volumes in dev clusters to avoid node disk bloat.
- For persistent storage, explore **PersistentVolume (PV)** and **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)**.
